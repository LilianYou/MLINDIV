# MLINDIV
Maze Learning - Individual Differences (MLINDIV) is an expansive project that employs neuroimaging, behavioral testing, and computational methods to tease out individual differences in spatial navigation. More specifically, this project uses MRI data obtained from nearly 100 subjects before, during, and after their participation in a maze navigation experiment to explore neurological and behavioral differences in memory, learning, decision making, and other cognitive processes. This repository is meant to hold the most up to date scripts necessary for each subproject tied to MLINDIV.
